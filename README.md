# What is Bug bounty? 

A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities.

# The bug hunter..

The bug hunter test a website/app to see if there is any security bug in it , after finding a bug he report it to the website/app owner to help him securing her/his software, then the software owner send a bounty for the hunter as a gift for helping him.

# Earn $$ from finding and reporting bugs to companies

You can become Ethical Hacker who earns $$ from finding bugs in the web apps, Just from home.

# You can Learn for free, how to get started??

First of all you should have computer science knowledge , <b>IN ORDER TO HACK A SOFTWARE YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW IT IS PROGRAMMED</b>

I recommend you to learn HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL QUERIES before diving into web security.

Also you should learn about networking, how to use linux, web technologies


After that you are ready to start learning how to hack, but before learning how to exploit you should learn how the vulnerability arises.
